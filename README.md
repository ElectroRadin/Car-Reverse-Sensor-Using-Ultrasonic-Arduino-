Car Reverse Sensor Using Ultrasonic (Arduino)

This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino to measure the distance between a car and obstacles behind it. When an object is detected within a certain range, the system triggers a buzzer or LED as a warning signal. Optionally, an LCD display can be used to show the exact distance.

Features:
Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor
Provides an alert with a buzzer or LED
Can display the distance on an LCD (optional)
Helps prevent collisions while reversing
